Demonstrate your application to deploy on S3 / SEBS using AWS CodePipeline
		Step 1: Create and Configure the S3 Bucket 
		1.	Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Console. 
		2.	Click Create bucket. 
		3.	Give it a globally unique name (e.g., my-codepipeline-demo-siteuniquename). 
			Uncheck "Block all public access". Acknowledge the warning. This is necessary to make your website public. 
		1.	Click create bucket. 
		2.	Go into your new bucket, click the Properties tab. 
		1.	Scroll down to Static website hosting and click Edit. 
		2.	Enable it, set the Index document to index.html, and save changes. 
		3.	Go to the Permissions tab, click Edit under Bucket policy, and paste the following policy. Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your bucket's name. 
		Step 2: Create the AWS CodePipeline 
		1.	Navigate to the CodePipeline service in the AWS Console. 
		2.	Click Create pipeline. 
		Step 3: Pipeline settings: 
		○	Pipeline name: My-S3-Website-Pipeline. 
		○   Leave Service role as is; CodePipeline will create a new one for you. ○   Click Next. 
		Step 4: Source stage: 
		一	Source provider: Select GitHub (via GitHub App ). 
		○ Click Create a connection. A new window will open. Name your connection (e.g., my-github-connection) and connect to your GitHub account. 
		Step 4: Build stage: 
		o	Build provider: Select AWS CodeBuild. 
		○ Click Create project. A new window will appear. 
		Environment image: Managed image. 
		■ Operating system: Amazon Linux 2. 
		■ Runtime(s): Standard. 
		■ Image: aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64standard:5.0. 
		■ Buildspec: Check "Use a buildspec file". CodeBuild will automatically look for buildspec.yml in your repo's root
		o	Click Continue 	to CodePipeline.
		o	Click Next. 
		Step 5: Deploy stage: 
		Deploy provider: Select Amazon S3.
		Region: Your current region.
		Bucket: Select the S3 bucket you created earlier. 
		○ Check the box for "Extract file before deploy". This unzips the build artifact and places the files directly in the bucket. 
		Step 6: Review all the settings and click Create pipeline
		The pipeline will automatically start its first run. You can watch it progress through the stages. Once it succeeds, go to your S3 bucket's static website URL (from Properties -> Static website hosting) to see your live page!
